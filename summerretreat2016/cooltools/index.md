# little smartphone security

## what you can do

smartphones are daily used by almost everyone (in germany) BUT people have NO IDEA what their phone really does..
..this is and will be critical as more and more activities are shifted to carry out with a smartphone (banking, paying, tickets, etc.)

custom ROMs (operating systems from cell phone company):

* blocks the user out (not granting all rights completely control phone)
* are not updated for old phones, thus leaving doors for intruders wide open

<span style="color:orange"> there are working alternatives !! </span>

* root your phone (gives access to other types of apps)
* install an alternative operating system
* actively control phone network activity
